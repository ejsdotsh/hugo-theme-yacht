## filler content

Many blogs will display the amount of time it takes to read the content at the
top of an article. Let’s add that to our blog page template.

The average person reads anywhere from 200 to 250 words per minute2
depending on several factors. If you count the number of words in a page’s
content and divide it by 200, you’ll get a conservative estimate of the number
of minutes it’ll take to read your content.

Hugo has built-in functions for counting words and doing math, so in your
template, add the following code to your byline to determine and display the
reading time:

## has highightings

some `go`

```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println("yacht")
}
```
