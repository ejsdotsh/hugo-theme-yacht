# yacht

**y**et **a**nother **c**ustom **h**ugo **t**heme

when graduating from highschool, i was voted *"most likely to own a yacht"* by my senior class...i don't think this is what they meant

## getting your own yacht

the preferred way of getting a **yacht** for yourself, is using `hugo modules` in `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "github.com/ejsdotsh/yacht"

[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/ejsdotsh/yacht"
